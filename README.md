Press P to pause

For this assignment I created a version of Conway's game of life first by following along with the [Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/cellular-automata/#exercise-77) article provided. After making the code work I added a couple features to make the code more useful. I added a pause button that will stop the progression of the game at any point and the ability to click on a cell to chage its value. You can click on a cell during runtime, but it will usually dissapear right away if its not connected to another cell so I added a pause button so you can set up any pattern you want once you get rid of the existing cells.
